# Ivy-Final-Project
Here I designed the game known as ‘Fruit Pluck Game’ using React for frontend, Spring for Backend and Postgresql for Database .
Here the concept of game is, multiple fruits would be falling down with certain speed and certain points are associated with each fruit.
There would be a basket which we use to collect them.
By the time the fruit falls down from the canvas(game) region, we need to catch those using mouse pluck/clicking towards that fruit,
so that the basket would be moving towards it to collect it.
User score would be calculated according to the fruits and no of fruits he can collect with in given limited time.
Maximum score would be displayed at bottom of all his attempted scores.
